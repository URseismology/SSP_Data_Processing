Figure. Location of the stations provided. 2 borehole stations (circles) and 17 ocean-bottom stations (triangles). The stations are color-coded based on the number of years deployed (red, 1 year deployments; white, 2 year deployments; black, 3 year deployments). Adapted from Figure 2 of Olugboji et al. (2016).
